# COVID_Vaccines
In this repository I show how I did a exploratory analysis using SQL Server. The result of that exploratory analysis is the dashboard that I create in tableau [(Link to dashboard)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leonardo.ferigutti/viz/COVID_Vaccines/Dashboard1?publish=yes).

In this case it can be seen that there are a considerable drop in the rate of new deaths/cases when the vaccine started to be implemented. The best example of this behaviour is United Kindom and other countries where there is a high-percentage of fully vaccinated people.
